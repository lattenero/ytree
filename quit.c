#include "ytree.h"

/*
quit-to-directory (xtree: alt-Q)(ytree: shift-Q, ^Q)
this uses the Ztree method.
for this to work, a ytree is called via a function in ~/.bashrc
instead of directly. that function generates a pid-unique
file containing a "cd cwd" line before calling ytree, and 
sources-in the pid-unique file afterward, thus jumping to the
directory specified.
if ytree rewrites that file to the quit-to dir, the eventual
command-prompt will be in that chosen dir.
thus, a Quit exit jumps to the dir it's already in. a QuitTo
exit jumps to the dir_entry-specified dir.

QuitTo:

- get parent's pid
- get owning uid's homedir
- compose shell stub name
- test: 
  - exists?
  - regular file?
  - non-zero length?
- write dir_entry to it, thus replacing the starting-cwd line
- chain to Quit

if user elects not to quit, no harm done: 

- rewrite that file to starting-cwd if it passes those checks again
  (avoiding race opening vuln)
- return to main program loop 

a user can have a bunch of ytrees open, but they'll be run one-per-
shell (i.e. each xterm singletasking) unless the user's ASKING for 
trouble, so a given shell-pid will be unique for the xterm that 
owns it, even though they're all clustered in the user's homedir.

changes:
- ytree.h		add	prototype for QuitTo
- filewin.c		add call to QuitTo, for Q and ^Q
- dirwin.c		add call to QuitTo, for Q and ^Q (q still falls to main)

i've mapped this to ^Q for now on my home machine, but it's probably best to
use just SHIFT-Q for this, following the trend of mapping XtreeGold
Alt-commands to SHIFT-commands in ytree/xtc. that leaves ytree usable in
serial terminals with soft (XOFF/XON) line control protocol.

in .bashrc:
#
# "yt" is part of getting ytree to quit to the target directory rather
# than the starting one (Alt-Q rather than Q, in XTG terms).
# the pid-numbered chdir "bat" will get rewritten to the selected
# dir if ytree is Quit or ^Quit rather than quit, if ytree-1.75b
# (or later version, assuming Werner incorporates my changes) is used. 
# This method is based on Kim Henkel's alt-Q batfile method for ZtreeWin.
